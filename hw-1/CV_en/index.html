            <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am 23 years old. At 16 years, passing the examinations via extern for grades 10-11, graduated from high school and immediately entered in IFNMU.
                    I appreciate the friendly team and responsibility in colleagues. Studied German 2 months at courses in Munich. The last 2 years I was lived in Warsaw, Poland. 
                    I can quickly adapt to different conditions. Always pay attention to details. 
                    I like an active lifestyle, spontaneous travel, I have been involved in mountain tourism/tracking since my youth, now I playing ultimate (frisbee). 
                    I like make mobile photography and constantly taking part in various photo contests.
                    During my student years, I drew a lot and even maked tattoo, later I came across graphic design where I heard about the Front-end and web programming.
                    For about 2 years I was interested in the profession of a Front-end developer, visited a lot of webinars and an interactive course from htmlacademy.ru
